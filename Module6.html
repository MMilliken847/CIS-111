         Using your fingers, pull the hair straight upwards to ensure that the overall length is uniform. Then, instead of cutting hairs across the middle, angle your scissors so that they are parallel to the hair that is poking through your fingers.

            Since actress Audrey Hepburn wore the cut in her first movie, Roman Holiday, in the 1950s, ladies have always loved the shorter, cropped pixie hairstyle.

            The US, Europe, and Asia—especially Korea, Japan, and China—are hotspots for pixie cuts. Because of its versatility—you may wear it slicked back, spiked, with tight curls, finger waved, or in a messy style—it is a go-to look for women of all colors. This well-liked haircut is ideal for ladies who wish to go really short.
